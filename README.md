# Customer Identity Book (CIB)

This Python script implements a virtual Customer Identity Book (CIB) using a console-based menu that determines the action based on the user's choice. The system permits users to perform various operations, add and remove customers, search for customers, update customer details, see all customers' details, and sort customers according to their last names.
Customer data are saved only during the program runtime. Customers are not saved externally once the termination has been completed.
